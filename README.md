# AIFSG_Trigger_Warning
A ML based Chrome Extension to help filter sensitive content. By Andrew Rippy, Klaijan Sinteppadon, and Olivia Xu. 
Project for Carnegie Mellon Univeristy - AI For Social Good, 17737, taught by Fei Fang, Spring 2023.

## Basic Usage
In order to use this plugin, there are two main components.

### The Extension Interface
The raw unpacked extension is housed inside the AISG Exten folder. To load this, enable devloper mode in Google Chrome, head to the extension page, and click load unpacked. Navigate to this folder and click load. This will load the extension into your browser.

### The WebPy Backend
Open a python3 shell and simply type "python backend.py". This will start a localhost server on port 8080 for the chrome extension to interface and send/recieve data from. 

### That's it! Simple, right? I hope this helps anyone struggling with trigger topics. Any way we can help, it's AI FOR SOCIAL GOOD!! Have a nice day, and thanks for being.
